<h4 align="left">Placement Prediction System<br>This is an end-to-end Machine Learning project where I built and deployed a placement prediction system using Python and Flask. The system predicts whether a student will be placed based on their CGPA and IQ. The entire pipeline, from data preprocessing to model deployment, has been developed in this project.<br><br>üöÄ Project Pipeline<br>‚Ä¢ Data Preprocessing and EDA<br>Cleaned the dataset and performed exploratory data analysis to identify key patterns and insights. Selected the most relevant features for the model.<br><br>‚Ä¢ Feature Selection<br>Extracted and selected CGPA and IQ as the input features to predict student placement.<br><br>‚Ä¢ Feature Scaling<br>Applied StandardScaler to normalize the input features for better model performance.<br><br>‚Ä¢ Train-Test Split<br>Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance fairly.<br><br>‚Ä¢ Model Training<br>Used Logistic Regression for binary classification to predict whether a student will be placed.<br><br>‚Ä¢ Model Evaluation<br>Measured the model's accuracy to ensure reliable and trustworthy predictions.<br><br>‚Ä¢ Deployment<br>Deployed the model locally using Flask and developed a user-friendly web interface for real-time predictions.<br><br>üåê Live Demo<br>Users can input their CGPA and IQ to predict the likelihood of a student being placed.<br><br>The web interface is built with HTML5, CSS3 and is fully interactive for a smooth user experience.<br><br>üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack<br>‚Ä¢ Python<br>‚Ä¢ Pandas<br>‚Ä¢ Scikit-learn<br>‚Ä¢ Flask<br>‚Ä¢ Frontend<br>‚Ä¢HTML5/CSS3<br><br><br>‚öñÔ∏è Model Evaluation<br>The model was evaluated using accuracy metrics, ensuring reliable predictions.<br><br>Additional performance metrics (e.g., confusion matrix, precision, recall) can be added for further improvements.<br><br>‚ú® Future Enhancements<br>Deploy the model to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS).<br><br>üí¨ Feel free to reach out for any questions or improvements!</h4>
